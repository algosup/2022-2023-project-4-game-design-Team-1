### Problem solving

Problem 1: Not having a prototype of our video game in time.

‚û°Ô∏è Impact: No game prototype to present in time.
‚û°Ô∏è Effort: Do something but on paper.

#### DMAIC problem

Define:
‚û°Ô∏è Our problem :
Not having a prototype of our video game in time.

‚û°Ô∏è The limits:
We are limited in time as it is presented.

Measure:
‚û°Ô∏è Prepare something on paper to outline what we would implement in the game.
‚û°Ô∏è Implement our ideas with a visual.

Analyze:
‚û°Ô∏è Good for a prototype but is to be improved for the demo.

Improve:
‚û°Ô∏è We need to improve the difficulty of the puzzles and work well on the visual of them.

Control:
‚û°Ô∏è Yes.
